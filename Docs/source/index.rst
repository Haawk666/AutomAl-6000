========================================================================
Welcome to the AutomAl 6000 home-page!
========================================================================

The AutomAl 6000 project is the master-project of student Haakon Tvedt at the department of physics, NTNU.
The general aim of the project is to build a software tool to aid in the analysis of HAADF-STEM images,
initially focused specifically around images of precipitates in the Al-Mg-Si-(Cu) 6xxx precipitation sequences.

The software consists of core methodology and a functional GUI, is written in python with PyQt5 resources
for the GUI, and is open-source.

To find out more about the underlying technology and methodology, take a look at the master thesis [TBA]
To get started with AutomAl, check out the guides provided on this web-site, linked in the left content-bar.
Also consider checking out the 'about' page and the further-work page to learn more about the involved parties
and future road-map for the project. The blog on this page also gives regular updates on the work that is currently
