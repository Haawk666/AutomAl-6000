========================================================================
Welcome to the AutomAl 6000 home-page!
========================================================================

AutomAl 6000 is a stand-alone software tool for semi-automatic labelling of HAADF-STEM images of precipitates in the
6xxx aluminium alloys, developed as a part of my master-project in physics at NTNU. Main features include:

   - Basic column detection
   - Column characterization algorithm
   - Flexible statistical modelling
   - Atomic graphs for user interactions with the structure data
   - GUI
   - Imports dm3, TIFF and AtoMap file formats
   - Exports csv, png and svg file formats
   - Open-source

To find out more about the underlying methodology, take a look at the general presentation or the master
thesis, available under the **links** section. A paper is also in the works, and will be cited here when available.

To get started with AutomAl, check out the guides provided on this web-site, or the youtube tutorial-series, also under
the **links** section.

This web-page is currently under construction.
