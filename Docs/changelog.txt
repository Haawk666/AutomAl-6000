AACC 0.0.0
From specialization project version to first restructured version 0.0.0


New features in 0.0.0:
-----------------
- Fully restructured both the core program and the GUI from scratch.
  This will hopefully make the program structure more sensible and thus make life easier in the future.
  Tried to lay good structural foundations for future features
  
- Added terminal output as a new widget, allowing the core to report on its progress and other program
  info to be displayed. The logging module is now used to generate intermodular reporting.

- Marginally improved column detection: Vertex positions are now calculated as float values rather
  than pixel indicies. This allows columns to have more fine-tuned positions and evades pixel
  snapping as it used to. It has escpecially improved the accuracy of column positions in realtively
  low resolution images (Such as large particles).
  
- Column characterization has had a major ovehaul. New and better statistical analysis has uncovered new distributions
  over several parameters. Weak and strong untangling has been done from scratch. New methods for analysing levels,
  finding intersections much more have been implemented, and is in early testing.
  
- Implemented better version handling. If the core detects a save-file from a previous version, it will
  run a script that loads the instance in a compatible version and transforms the data to the current
  version. Hopefully this will ensure backwards compatibility with save-states through all versions!
  (Adding a new attribute to the SuchSoftware, AtomicGraph, Egde or Vertex classes breaks save-file
  compatibility, which is a hassle...) Note: Version compatibility will only be preserved starting from
  this version (0.0.0). Due to how pickle works, it was not possible to write a dynamic script to
  handle version conversion from the previous version. I had to make this conversion by writing two
  different scripts that must be run explicitly. If file conversion from the previous version to
  version 0.0.0 is needed, send me the files and I can convert them and return them manually!
  
- Added some keyboard shortcuts: When you have a column selected, press 1 to instantly change its
  species to Aluminium, 2 for Magnesium, 3 for Silicon and 4 for Copper. Use the '+' key to easily
  toggle the column height between 0, 1 and 2. (0 corresponds to the 0-plane, 1 corresponds to the
  1/2-plane and 2 is a special height that is intended for special cases, such as beta prime corners).
  If you have 'enable move' enabled, you can use the 'w/a/s/d'-keys to move the selected column at pixel
  increments (Make sure the central widget has focus). You can now also cycle through the tabs of the
  central widget with the 'x' and 'z'-key. (x takes you to the right, z to the left)
  
- Improved the visual cue in overlay and graph-views of the currently selected column.
  
- Enableded zooming of the tab-views with 'shift+mousescrollwheel'. 'alt+mouswheel' will scroll the
  view horizontally' and simply scrolling will scroll the view vertically. This made the GUI 'feel' a
  lot less restrained and was sorely needed in my opinion.
  
- The tab-views are now linked, meaning that if you zoom in and translate your view to a specific area
  in the graph-tab, when you switch to for instance the overlay-tab, it will be zoomed in and translated
  to the same area. This allows you to swiftly switch between views of the same image feature. In the 
  future I plan to have a checkbox that toggles this feature.
  
- Added a vertex report button that will print a report of vertex/column properties to the right-side
  window. Also added a button 'print index', which will print only the index of the column to the console,
  in case you need to remember it for later. (No more writing down full pages of vertex indices by hand).
  Pressing the 'stats' button in the image controls group will now also report image and particle stats
  to the console window, instead of showing it in a pop-up-box. This is convenient in many ways.
  
- When manually setting the species of a column, this is now respected by the algorithm and no changes
  will be made to that column unless you reset it with the new 'reset column' button.
  
- Added an option in the overlay filters to toggle show/hide columns that have been set by the user.

- Vectorized some old code, producing a slight optimization on some sub-processes.

- Wrote program-wide tooltips.

- Added the option of a new 'dark' theme that is better for reviewing images in the dark!

- implemented perturbation mode.

- Made several plotting features for data-mining purposes.

- Implemented concept of sub-graphs and a new tab for this.

- Made an api for writing plugins, as well as an example plugin.

- Wrote a data-export wizard!

- Made a new group-box type that can be expanded or collapsed by doubble-clicking
  

Bugfixes:
-----------------
- Fixed some of the buggines in the overlay filters, but work still remains on this.

- A lot of code has been changed in this update, and not much time for testing, so many new bugs have
  probarbly been introduced, Yehaaw!

- Fixed the crashing when closing and loading projects bug. (I think...)

- Tried to clean the code as much as time allowed (Still a lot of cleaning and optimization to be done!)


other:
-----------------
- Slightly started the daunting task of properly commenting and formatting docstrings. The first priority
  is the graph.py file.

- Made a validation set of images that the algorithm can be compared with through a script. This will
  enable quick statistics of the effectiveness of any new change made to the algorithm. This will hopefully
  streamline the future effort a bit. This script can be run from the debug menu and will print a report.
 
- set up a repo at gitHUB and is now actively using version control.
